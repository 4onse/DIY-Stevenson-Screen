## Notes

You'll also need 4 stainless steel threaded rods you can source anywhere to push
through the 4 channels that line up when you put them together. That gives it
lateral strength and you can mount it either top or bottomside

You will also need a bottom plate below the last segment to protect the inner
tube channel (where the sensors should be placed) from ground IR/UV reflection
that could taint measurement results

It's up to you to place a fan above the channel (in areas where some forced
convection is needed to get air flowing through it) - in most cases the design
was made with natural convection in mind, so that warmer air in the outside
channel would rise up and therefore also triggering air movement within the
channel that is fed from the bottom.

Corrections, Updates, Enhancements and PRs are always welcome.
